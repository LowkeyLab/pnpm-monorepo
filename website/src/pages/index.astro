    description="I like to think of myself as a 1x engineer who creates 10x engineers. I'm passionate about building tools that help developers iterate faster and more efficiently. I'm mainly immersed in Java, Kotlin, and TypeScript. In my free time I experiment with toolchains and software ecosystems. I will talk your ears off about build systems, CI pipelines, and deployment methodologies."
